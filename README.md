After eating chocolate bars your whole life, you’ve decided to go on a quest to find the greatest chocolate bar in the world.


You’ve found a website (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/beautifulsoup/cacao/index.html) that has over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars from all around the world. It’s displayed in the web browser on this page.


The data is displayed in a table, instead of in a csv or json. Thankfully, we have the power of BeautifulSoup that will help us transform this webpage into a DataFrame that we can manipulate and analyze.


The rating scale is from 1-5, as described in this review guide: http://flavorsofcacao.com/review_guide.html. A 1 is “unpleasant” chocolate, while a 5 is a bar that transcends “beyond the ordinary limits”.


Some questions we thought about when we found this dataset were: Where are the best cocoa beans grown? Which countries produce the highest-rated bars? What’s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?
